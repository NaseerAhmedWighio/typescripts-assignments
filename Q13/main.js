// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var transportation = ['Civic', 'Bike', 'Bus', 'Suzuki'];
for (var i = 0; i < transportation.length; i++) {
    console.log('I would like to own a ' + transportation[i]);
}
