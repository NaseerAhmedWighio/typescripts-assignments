//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!


// List of animals with a common characteristic
const animals: string[] = ['cat', 'dog', 'goat'];

// Printing the names of each animal using a for of loop
console.log("List of animals:");
for (const animal of animals) {
    console.log(animal);
}

// Print a statement about each animal
console.log("\nStatements about each animals;");
for (const animal of animals) {
    if (animal === 'dog')
    {
        console.log(`A ${animal} is a great pet.`);
    } 

    else if (animal === 'cat') 
    {

        console.log(`A ${animal} would be a good companion at home.`);

    } 

    else if (animal ==='goat')
