//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufacturer, model) {
    var properties = [];
    for (var _i = 2; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {
        properties[_i - 2] = arguments[_i];
    }
    var car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
    };
    for (var _a = 0, properties_1 = properties; _a < properties_1.length; _a++) {
        var _b = properties_1[_a], key = _b[0], value = _b[1];
        car[key] = value;
    }
    return car;
}
// Example usage:
var myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Corolla", ["color", "red"], ["optional Feature", "sunroof"], ["speed", "280 KM/hour"]);
console.log(myCar);
