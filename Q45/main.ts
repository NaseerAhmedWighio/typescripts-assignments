//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...properties: [string, any][]): any {
    const car: any = {
        manufacturer,
        model,
    };

    for (const [key, value] of properties) {
        car[key] = value;
    }

    return car;

}

// Example usage:
const myCar: string = createCar("Toyota", "Corolla", ["color", "red"], ["optional Feature", "sunroof"], ["speed", "280 KM/hour"]);


console.log(myCar);
